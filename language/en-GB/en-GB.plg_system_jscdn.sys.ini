PLG_SYSTEM_JSCDN="System - Javascript from CDN"
PLG_SYSTEM_JSCDN_XML_DESCRIPTION="Replaces the preloaded javascript urls with defined alternatives like CDNs. Do not worry, it is fast and do not add any javascript that is not already preloaded, e.g.<br /> /media/jui/js/jquery.min.js <br />with <br />//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js <br />Some examples are added by default. <br />The Prefix is added to the old source path and defaults to the Joomla JURI::root(true) variable. <br />Be aware <br /> - that you might have to maintain the version to load if the requirements change. <br /> - test that you added valid paths for the new sources. There are no automatic checks."
